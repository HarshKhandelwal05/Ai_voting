# AI-Based Voting Recommendation

## Project Description

The **AI-Based Voting Recommendation** project implements a simple smart contract in Solidity for an AI voting advisor. The contract allows users to vote on different options, tracks their votes, and ensures that each user can only vote once. The contract is written with no imports, constructors, or input fields. 

The smart contract facilitates decentralized decision-making, providing a transparent and secure voting mechanism. It is intended to serve as a foundational example of how to implement a basic voting system using Ethereum smart contracts.

## Features

- **Vote for Options**: Users can vote on four predefined options.
- **Track Votes**: The contract tracks votes for each option in real-time.
- **One Vote per Address**: Each address can vote only once to ensure fairness.
- **Event Emission**: A voting event is emitted each time a user casts their vote, allowing for full transparency.
- **No Constructors/Imports/Input Fields**: The contract is written with simplicity in mind, without the use of constructors or external libraries.
